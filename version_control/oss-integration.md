## Version Control Systems interaction with Open Source Software & community

Not every version control is embraced, used by and integrated into the Open Source world the same. Open Source programs offer many advantages over their closed source counterparts, and this relationship needs to be a factor in any version control system decisions.

This section identifies how products participate and support the Open Source community.
