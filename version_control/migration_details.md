## Future VCS migration concerns

The version control system one uses today is not the VCS one will use in the future.  Therefore, the capability to import and export all code and data from the current VCS system to the next generation VCS is of utmost importance in selecting a VCS, and thus maximize access and re-usability of all code in the future. 

The following table lists the capability to export and import data from one VCS system to another VCS systems. The columns represent source systems {FROM}; the rows represent the destination systems {TO}.

As the table demonstrates, there is only one VCS that spans the entire row (Github Enterprise), meaning that it would accomodate all legacy code in all current VA VCS systems, allowing VA's code to be managed by one single "Universal Repository". No other VCS has this capability.
