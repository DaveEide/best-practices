## Future VCS migration concerns
The version control system (VCS) one uses today likely not be the version control system one uses in the future.  

Therefore the capability to transfer data and code into and out of different VCS systems is of utmost importance to assuring the future access and re-usability of the code.

Using the TRM-listed VCS, the following table lists the capability to transfer data from one VCS system to another VCS system. 
The columns represent source systems; the rows represent the destination systems.

__Of note is that Github Enterprise is the only VCS capabile of importing all data and code of all other VCS systems, i.e.  "Universal Repository".__ No other VCS system has this universal import/exprt capability.

| When reviewing tools and techniques, we used tools officially supported by the VCS or had a long history of working successfully. |
