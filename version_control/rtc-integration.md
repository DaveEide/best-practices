## How Version Control Systems integrate with Rational Team Concert

Rational Team Concert (RTC) is a suite of productivity tools from IBM that includes collaborative planning, version control, build and deployments, and reporting. It integrates standalone IBM tools, including ClearCase, to create a integrated suite of tools for the software development process.

VA has standardized on RTC for reporting and planning within VIP, but not explicitly any other of it's use cases.

Over the past few years, IBM has received pushback from their complete suite, and has started to open up integration amongst external tools. This page attempts to describe some of those integrations.
