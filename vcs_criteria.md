## VIP Version Control Criteria

The Veteran Affairs (VA) VIP program has standardized on a feature and bug tracking tool as well as a reporting tool in IBM Rational Team Concert. However, it has not defined a Version Control System.

This document attempts to layout the criteria (and justification) that VIP should factor when deciding on a VCS system of record.
