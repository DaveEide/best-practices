## VIP Version Control Criteria

The Veteran Affairs (VA) VIP program has standardized on a feature and bug tracking tool as well as a reporting tool in IBM Rational Team Concert. However, it has not defined a Version Control System.

This document attempts to layout the criteria (and justification) that VIP should factor when deciding on a VCS system of record.

* Ease of Use (including IDE-support)
* Ease of Training
* Integration with other preferred tools, including RTC
* Collaboration
* Discovery
* Web-Interface
* Minimize Vendor Lock-in
* Uses Modern Deveopment Best Practices
* RoadMap is strong
