* __Enterprise Source Control:__  https://enterprise.github.com
* __Enterprise Collaboration:__  https://github.com/integrations
* __Government Collaboration:__ https://government.github.com
* __Government Best-Practices:__   https://github.com/government/best-practices


What is the VA strategy going forward?  Does it include these best practices and tools?
