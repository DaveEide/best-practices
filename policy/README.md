## VA Software Development Policy Considerations

As the Veterans Affairs Administration continues to improve it's software development and technical proccesses (via programs like VIP), it must continue to advance its policies to keep pace with modern technical innovation. These policies and procedures are also required in order to meet the requirements of the new [Federal Source Code Policy](sourcecode.cio.gov), defined as:

> Within 90 days of the publication date of this policy, each agency’s CIO—in consultation with the agency’s CAO—shall develop an agency-wide policy that addresses the requirements of this document.; and

> Within 120 days of the publication date of this policy, each agency must update—and thereafter keep up to date—its inventory of agency information resources to include an enterprise code inventory that lists custom-developed code for or by the agency after the publication of this policy.

### To that end, defined within is:
* An update to the VIP program, defining policy related to Version Control and Source Code management. 
* *[VIP Policy](vip_policy.md).
* A VA Open Source Policy to define the definition of and handling of Open Source software within the Administration. 
* *[VA Open Source Policy](va_open_source_policy.md)
